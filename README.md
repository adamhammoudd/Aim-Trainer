# ðŸŽ¯ Aim Trainer

This is a simple Aim Trainer game built with Python and Pygame. The project is designed to help players improve their mouse accuracy and reaction speed by clicking on growing and shrinking targets.  

## Features
- **Dynamic Targets**: Targets grow and shrink over time, providing a challenge to the player.
- **Scoring System**: Tracks hits, misses, and speed (targets per second).
- **Player Name Input**: Players can input their names, and their high scores are saved.
- **High Scores**: Keeps track of high scores and displays them on the game-over screen even if the window is closed.
- **Interactive Menus**: Includes home, options, and game-over screens.
- **Difficulty**: Players can choose their difficulty based on their skill level.

4. Click on the targets as they appear. Be quick â€” targets will shrink and disappear if not clicked in time!
5. Avoid missing targets, as you only have 3 lives.
6. Check your stats and high scores after the game ends.
